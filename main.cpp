//	PROGRAMMER		:	William Anderson
// 
//	DESCRIPTION		:	This program presents a main menu to the user with the following options: Create New Recipe, Read Recipe, Enter Meal Plan, 
//						Generate Random Meal Plan, Generate Grocery List, and Exit Program. The first four options are available to the user to
//						eventually allow them to choose option five: Generate Grocery List. All recipes available to the user are entered by the
//						user, so the program is meant to allow the user to easily get a grocery list for the recipes they already use.
